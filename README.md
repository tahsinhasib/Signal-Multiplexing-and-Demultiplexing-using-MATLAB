# Signal Multiplexing & Demultiplexing using MATLAB

A sequence of binary bits were converted into analog signals using ASK (Amplitude shift keying). Then the ASK signal was multiplexed using FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing). Later the composite Analog signal was demultiplexed back into individual Analog signals.
